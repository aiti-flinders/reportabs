```{r}
#| label: setup
library(reportabs)
labour_force <- read_absdata("labour_force")
```

`abs_plot()` will do most of the heavy lifting for you, if you know the indicator you want to plot. If not, typing plot_ and pressing tab will show the included plots. `abs_plot(labour_force, indicator = "Employed total")` is identical to `plot_employed_total("Australia")`.

```{r, "abs-plot-example", fig.height = 5, units = "cm", dpi = 96}
abs_plot(labour_force, over = list(indicator = "Employed total", states = "Australia"))

```
